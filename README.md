# CreeperConfetti
Creeper Confetti is a plugin for Minecraft servers that replaces all creeper explosions with nice-looking confetti ones.

When creeper explodes it doesn't destroy blocks, but it'll damage all entities around just like normal explosion.

This plugin is really small and easy to make, but I think it suites quite well to small servers for some friends. If you find(I don't think it's possible lol) any bugs, just report them in the issues section. You can also post there features requests.

One of the upcoming feature will be configurable creeper damage(none, or percentage so for example 50% of normal explosion damage)

# Installation
To install the plugin you need spigot server. No other plugins required. Just drop the file CreeperConfetti.jar to plugins folder. Restart the server and enjoy!

# Why if I can do just "/gamerule mobGriefing false"?
Command also disables other things like villager food farms so it's just safer for server. Also really lightweight.
